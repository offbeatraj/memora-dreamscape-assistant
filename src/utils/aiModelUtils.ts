    "When someone with Alzheimer's is confused about time, using environmental cues like opening curtains to show darkness can help reorient them gently without confrontation.",
    "A person-centered approach focuses on the emotional need behind behaviors. If they're anxiously preparing for work, they may be seeking purpose or routine, which you can address with reassurance.",
    "Validation therapy acknowledges feelings as real even when the situation isn't accurate. This builds trust and reduces anxiety compared to correcting misconceptions.",
    "Redirection works well after validation - first acknowledge their feelings, then suggest an alternative like 'Let's have some tea and get comfortable until morning. I'll make sure you're up on time.'",
    "Avoid arguing or using logic to convince someone with Alzheimer's they're wrong, as this can increase agitation. Instead, focus on comfort and emotional reassurance."

Without knowing more specific details, I can suggest general person-centered care principles:

2. Use simple, clear communication
3. Maintain a calm, reassuring demeanor
4. Focus on ${patientPossessive} emotional needs rather than factual accuracy
5. Create a structured routine that provides security and familiarity
